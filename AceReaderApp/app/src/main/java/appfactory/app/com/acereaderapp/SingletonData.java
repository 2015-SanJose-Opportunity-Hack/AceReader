The rabbit decided it was time to become friends with the wolf. Wali was open to new ideas and fancied herself to be a leader. They lived in the same neighborhood and Rabi believed that they needed to be nice to each other. Rabi knew that this would be difficult because Wali was always chasing him and other rabbits. Wali the wolf had even eaten some of the rabbitâ€™s friends for dinner. Rabi knew that when Wali was hungry, she acted without thinking. Rabi wanted Wali to think of the consequences of her actions on all his rabbit friends. Rabi also hoped that Wali would set an example for the other wolves that rabbits and wolves could live together as friends.";
