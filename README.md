Framework for Prototype
Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to develop a prototype of Reading Ace. 

One of Reading Ace’s key modes will focus on student assessment.  We will provide students with passages and associated questions for that passage across different subcategories tied to each of the five components of learning.

When a student is served a passage for reading, they will be able to select a word in the passage and have the rest of the passage read to them aloud while each word being read is highlighted on the screen (default starts at the beginning) and press a button to cancel the passage being read.  The student can choose to have the passage read to them as many times as they like.  We want to track how often a student read the passage and how long they spent reading the passage.

Once the student has read the passage, they will be served with quizzes of 5 questions each from the pool of questions provided to test their level of understanding across all subtopics. During a quiz, students should be able to easily toggle back to or view the passage if they need to review it or have it read to them again.  Since each question will be mapped to a subcategory of the Big 5, we’ll be able to identify where students have problems.  They can be served additional questions in future quizzes for question from subcategories that they are getting wrong.  These subcategories will also be flagged as “Attention Needed.”

Students will need to pass a score threshold on certain number of quizzes for each passage to move on to the next passage. It may be that they need to score 80% or more on 3 consecutive quizzes to master that passage. The app should give them a message saying you have mastered the topic. 

Extra Credit

Basic reporting to show how students did in each quiz and across each subcategory/ question type should be part of the application along with time spent per quiz/per question.

Technology Limitations
We desire this to be a self-contained Android application (preferably written using PhoneGap as that is our dev platform but not necessary for the prototype). 

Since internet is not reliable in rural villages where the app is to be deployed, the application cannot be dependent on internet access in any way.
